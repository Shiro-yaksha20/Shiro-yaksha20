# Shiro-yaksha20

**Student Developer | Agentic AI Practitioner**

I build software through agentic AI workflows, leveraging autonomous coding agents as my primary development methodology rather than traditional manual programming.

## Philosophy

I approach software development differently. Instead of memorizing syntax or maintaining a rigid tech stack, I collaborate with AI agents to design, iterate, and ship functional software. This paradigm allows me to focus on problem-solving, architecture, and user experience while AI handles implementation details.

My work reflects a belief that the future of development lies in human-AI collaboration, where developers become orchestrators of intelligent systems.
